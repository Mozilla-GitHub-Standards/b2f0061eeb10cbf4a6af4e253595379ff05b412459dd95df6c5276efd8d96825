# Welcome to the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) Open Guides Repository!
We started this repository to be a central place for guides, tips &amp; tricks, and/or advice for working open based off queries and suggestions from our [#openscience](https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience) community.

## Who are we?
Mozilla Science Lab was started in 2013 to help scientists, librarians, researchers, citizen scientists... anyone interested, really... work openly and do better research, more research, and make that research more useful by sharing it widely.

## What is this repository for?

We frequently receive queries and suggestions from community members asking for guidance, tips, expertise around various topics.  Rather than answer these one-by-one and repeating that info next time it's asked, we thought we'd put together a central repository where we can develop guides & cheat sheets to be referred to when needed by anyone.

## What do we need?

Suggestions and expertise from you!

We need suggestions & feedback for new guides and old.  Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/mozillascience/openguides/issues) list to see which guides are being proposed or are underway.

We need expertise to help us create the guides.  Don't worry if you don't know how to edit GitHub.  If you're interested in helping, just drop us a line at [sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org) and we'll be in touch.

## How can you get invovlved?

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/mozillascience/openguides/issues) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of, either add to the existing issue on that topic or start a new one!  Again, if you aren't sure how to work in GitHub, let us know and we'll be happy to provide resources to help.

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. We expect all collaborators and contributors to adhere to our [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) in all interactions, both on and offline.
